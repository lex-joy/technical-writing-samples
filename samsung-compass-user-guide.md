# Configuring the Compass

The compass app includes configuration mechanisms to ensure that the information it provides is as precise as possible. Use the following procedures to configure the compass as needed.


## Setting the Location

The compass app automatically determines your latitude, longitude, and town/city/country using your phone’s location services.

For instructions on activating your phone’s location services, see [Setup](#setup).


## Calibrating the Compass

The compass app should be calibrated periodically to ensure accurate readings.

To calibrate the compass app:

1. On the bottom of the compass screen, press **Calibrate**.
2. Tilt and rotate your phone back and forth as prompted.

When the compass finishes calibrating, it automatically returns to the compass screen.


# Reading the Compass

The compass app simulates several of the major features of a physical compass while displaying key navigation information in an easy-to-read format.

The following information is shown on the compass screen:

* **Index Line**: The blue line on top of the central blue circle is the index line. It indicates the direction your phone is currently pointing.
* **Bearing**: The center number indicates your bearing, shown in degrees. The bearing can also be found by determining where the index line would intersect the outer ring.
* **Direction**: The blue letters to the left of the bearing indicate the one- or two-letter abbreviation for the cardinal or intercardinal direction you are currently facing.
* **Location**: The text beneath the simulated compass housing indicates your precise latitude, longitude, and town/city/country.

> **Note**
> 
> If the location information is unavailable, enable the phone’s location services by following the instructions under [Setup](#setup).

# Navigating with the Compass

The compass app is designed to help you maintain a consistent path of travel in environments where it is difficult to keep your destination in sight.

To navigate with the compass app:

1. Face toward a distant object that you would like to reach.
2. Hold your phone flat at the level of your chest.
3. Take note of the bearing that the compass displays. (It is advisable to record a note on your phone in case you forget the bearing.)
4. Proceed in the direction of the appropriate bearing until you reach the desired destination.

If you deviate from your course:

1. Pause where it is safe to do so.
2. Point yourself in the direction of the appropriate bearing.
3. Resume travel in the direction of the bearing.
