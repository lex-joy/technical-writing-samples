# Deep Sea Adventure Instruction Manual

This document provides English instructions for playing [*Deep Sea Adventure*](https://oinkgms.com/en/deep-sea-adventure), a 2- to 6-player game by Jun Sasaki and Goro Sasaki. This adapts the English rules provided with the game for grammar and clarity, and resolves ambiguities present in the original.

## Introduction

You and a group of other daring deep sea divers head out to sea to dive for sunken treasure.

You're all rivals, but you're poor, so you're forced to share a rented submarine and **a single tank of air!**

The deeper you dive, the richer the treasures you'll find, but if you don't return to the sub before that tank of air depletes, you'll have to drop all the treasure you've collected in order to make it back on board alive.

It's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches!

## Components

* 2 six-sided dice, each with 2 faces numbering 1-3
* 6 Diver Pieces
* 1 Air Marker
* 1 Submarine Board
* 12 Blank Chips
* 32 Treasure Chips (8 chips for each of the 4 shapes)
    * Level 1: Triangular, 0-3 points (2 of each point value)
    * Level 2: Square, 4-7 points (2 of each point value)
    * Level 3: Pentagonal, 8-11 points (2 of each point value)
    * Level 4: Hexagonal, 12-15 points (2 of each point value)

## Game Setup

1. Place the submarine board where it is clearly visible to all players.
2. Place the air marker over the "25" slot on the submarine board.
3. Turn over the treasure chips to hide their values, separate them by level, and shuffle them thoroughly.
4. Line up the treasure chips in order by level from low to high, such that they connect to the submarine board. So long as they form a single line, any arrangement is acceptable.
5. Players take one diver piece each and place them flat on the submarine board, with the pieces' stomachs pointing down.
6. The player who has been in the ocean or gone swimming most recently takes the first turn.

## Objective

The game takes place over 3 rounds (3 deep sea dives).

Each dive begins with a full tank of air and all divers on the submarine board. The player who gains the most points over the three dives is the winner.

In order to gain points, you must bring treasure chips back to the submarine.

You can only return to the submarine once per dive.

A dive ends when all divers have returned to the submarine, or the air runs out.

## Turn Progression

Players take turns, going clockwise around the table.

On his or her turn, a player conducts the following four steps, unless s/he has already returned to the submarine.

### Step 1: Reduce Air

Move the air marker on the submarine board toward "0" by the number of treasure chips you are currently carrying. Treasure that you retrieved in previous rounds does not count toward this number.

**If the air falls to "0" or below, your turn is the last turn of the dive.** Continue and finish your turn.

### Step 2: Decide Whether to Turn Back

You may only turn back toward the submarine if you are carrying treasure.

If you decide to turn back, turn your diver to face the submarine. You can only change direction **once** each dive.

If you roll the dice without declaring a direction, you must dive deeper.

Once you have turned around, you can skip this step for the rest of the dive.

### Step 3: Roll for Movement

Roll both dice. Move your diver in the direction it is facing along the line of chips a number of jumps equal to your roll.

If you are carrying treasure, subtract the number of treasure chips you are carrying from your roll before moving. (**Note: In some cases, you may not be able to move!**)

When moving past an chip being explored by another diver, jump over that chip without counting it.

If your roll takes you beyond the last chip, stop on that chip.

### Step 4: Pick Up or Drop Treasure

Take **one** of the following three actions:

* Do nothing.
* Pick up the treasure chip your diver is stopped on, and place it in front of you without flipping it over. Put a blank chip in its place, and set your diver on top of that blank chip, facing the same direction it was facing before. You are now carrying this treasure. You can carry any number of treasure chips.
* If you are carrying treasure and are stopped on a blank chip, you may drop a treasure chip of your choice on that spot. Replace the blank chip with the treasure chip, and place your diver on that treasure chip, facing the same direction it was facing before.

## Round Conclusion

At the end of a dive, perform the following cleanup actions:

1. Players who made it back to the submarine turn over their treasure chips and reveal their values. They keep these treasure chips for scoring at the end of the game.
2. Players who did not make it back to the submarine before the end of the dive drop their treasure to the bottom of the sea and return to the submarine. In order, starting from the diver closest to the submarine, players stack their treasure chips (in any order they choose) next to the last chip in the line. Once 3 treasure chips have been stacked, the next chip begins a new stack at the end of the line. These stacks now function as a single treasure chip in subsequent dives. All treasure chips in a stack should be picked up, placed, and dropped together. They are also treated as a single treasure chip when calculating air consumption and movement.
3. Remove all blank chips from the line, and slide together the remaining chips to close any gaps.
4. The last player to return to the submarine takes the first turn of the next dive.

## Ending and Winning the Game

At the end of the third dive, after cleanup, players total their points (the values of all the treasure chips they brought back to the submarine) to find a winner.

If any players' point totals are tied, the player with the greater number of high-level treasure chips is the winner. If this does not break the tie, the game ends in a draw.
