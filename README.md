# Technical Writing Samples for Alexander Joy

This repository collects samples of [Alexander Joy](https://github.com/lex-joy)'s technical writing.

Virtually all of the projects I have completed for previous employers have been considered confidential and proprietary.
This means that I have not been permitted to share these documents as part of my public portfolio. Therefore, I have
written the following samples to showcase my technical documentation abilities:

* [Deep Sea Adventure Instructions](https://github.com/lex-joy/technical-writing-samples/blob/main/deep-sea-adventure-instructions.md): English instructions for playing [Deep Sea Adventure](https://oinkgms.com/en/deep-sea-adventure), a 2- to 6-player game by Jun Sasaki and Goro Sasaki. It adapts the English rules provided with the game for grammar and clarity, and resolves ambiguities present in the original.
* [Samsung Compass User Guide](https://github.com/lex-joy/technical-writing-samples/blob/main/samsung-compass-user-guide.md): A sample user guide that describes how to access, configure, and use the built-in compass app on the Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G (SM-G986U).
