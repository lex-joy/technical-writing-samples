# Technical Writing Samples for Alexander Joy

This repository collects samples of [Alexander Joy](https://github.com/lex-joy)'s technical writing.

* [Cogynt Documentation Site](https://docs.cogynt.com/): I currently work at Cogility as a Documentation Manager. This site collects all the documentation that I have written and directed.
* [Samsung Compass User Guide](https://github.com/lex-joy/technical-writing-samples/blob/main/samsung-compass-user-guide.md): A sample user guide that describes how to access, configure, and use the built-in compass app on the Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G (SM-G986U).
* [Deep Sea Adventure Instructions](https://github.com/lex-joy/technical-writing-samples/blob/main/deep-sea-adventure-instructions.md): English instructions for playing [Deep Sea Adventure](https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/deep-sea-adventure/), a 2- to 6-player game by Jun Sasaki and Goro Sasaki. It adapts the English rules provided with the game for grammar and clarity, and resolves ambiguities present in the original.
